            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hello! My name is Victor Kimaru and I am a passionate web developer from Nairobi, Kenya. I have been working
                in the field of web development for over 3 years now.</p>

            <p>I started my journey in technology when I was in high school. I was fascinated by how websites worked and
                decided to learn how to build them myself. Since then, I have never looked back.</p>

            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in Kenya. I completed my primary education at Nairobi Primary School and went on to
                study at Kenya High School. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of
                Nairobi.</p>

            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p>Apart from coding, I enjoy:</p>
            <ul class="skills-list">
                <li>Reading technology blogs and articles</li>
                <li>Playing football with friends</li>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Traveling and exploring new places</li>
                <li>Learning new programming languages</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer and work on projects that make a positive impact on people's
                lives. I believe technology can solve many problems in our society.</p>
